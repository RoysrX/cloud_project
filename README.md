Step 1: Create a Simple Blogging Website
Since we're using only HTML and CSS, weâ€™ll create a basic blog with a homepage and individual posts.

Step 2: Upload Website to AWS S3
2.1 Create an S3 Bucket
Go to AWS S3 Console
Click Create Bucket.
Give it a unique name (e.g., my-html-blog).
Disable Block Public Access (since CloudFront will serve it).
2.2 Upload the Website Files
Open your S3 bucket.
Go to Objects â†’ Click Upload.
Upload index.html, post1.html, and style.css.
2.3 Enable Static Website Hosting
In S3, go to Properties â†’ Static Website Hosting.
Enable Static Website Hosting.
Set index document as index.html.
Note the S3 website endpoint URL.

Step 3: Set Up CloudFront
3.1 Create a CloudFront Distribution
Open AWS CloudFront Console
Click Create Distribution.
In Origin Settings:
Origin Domain Name: Select your S3 bucket.
Viewer Protocol Policy: Choose Redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
Set Default Root Object to index.html.
Click Create Distribution.


Step 4: Access Your Blog
Once CloudFront finishes deploying (~5-10 mins).
Open the CloudFront Domain Name (e.g., d123xyz.cloudfront.net).
ðŸŽ‰ Your blog is now live!
